# vodaphone_aicte_internship
Power Bi and data Analytics projects
In this intenrship we actually got to meet with a lot of experienced people, we were to get trained through AICTE Vodaphone portal and then complete projects for which we can select topics from a given set of databases and problems. I have worked on 2 projects one is known as DIY project that is "Do it yourself" project and after that hands on learning and a session of reviews we got back things we can improve at and then we did our final individual projects. All over it was a great experience using power BI.
